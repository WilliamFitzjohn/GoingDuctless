          <h2>Why Toronto Businesses Choose Ductless HVAC</h2>
          <div className="benefits-grid">
            <div className="benefit-item">
              <h3>No Ductwork Required</h3>
              <p>Eliminate the cost and space requirements of installing or upgrading ductwork. Ideal for Toronto heritage buildings, tight spaces, and properties where traditional ducted systems aren't practical.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="benefit-item">
              <h3>Zone-Specific Control</h3>
              <p>Independent temperature control for each zone or room. Toronto businesses eliminate hot and cold spots while reducing energy waste from heating or cooling unoccupied areas.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="benefit-item">
              <h3>Energy Efficiency</h3>
              <p>Inverter-driven compressors modulate output to match demand. Ductless systems typically achieve higher SEER ratings than traditional HVAC, reducing Toronto commercial operating costs.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="benefit-item">
              <h3>Minimal Installation Disruption</h3>
              <p>Small refrigerant lines connect indoor and outdoor units through 3-inch wall penetrations. Toronto businesses avoid the major construction and downtime of ductwork installation.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="benefit-item">
              <h3>Heating & Cooling</h3>
              <p>Heat pump technology provides efficient heating during Toronto winters and cooling through summer. One system handles year-round climate control requirements.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="benefit-item">
              <h3>Quiet Operation</h3>
              <p>Indoor units operate as quietly as 19 dB. Critical for Toronto offices, medical facilities, and any commercial space where noise control matters.</p>
