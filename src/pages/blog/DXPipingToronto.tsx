          <h2>Understanding DX Refrigerant Piping</h2>
          <div className="explanation-content">
            <p>
              Direct Expansion (DX) piping carries refrigerant between outdoor and indoor HVAC components. Unlike hydronic systems that circulate water, DX systems move refrigerant directly to cooling or heating coils, expanding at the point of use for maximum efficiency. The quality of refrigerant piping installation directly impacts system performance, energy consumption, and equipment lifespan.
            </p>
            <h3>Critical DX Piping Components:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Copper Refrigerant Lines:</strong> Type L or ACR copper tubing sized for specific refrigerant flow requirements and system capacity</li>
              <li><strong>Insulation:</strong> Closed-cell foam insulation preventing condensation on suction lines and energy loss on liquid lines</li>
              <li><strong>Brazed Connections:</strong> High-temperature brazing using silver alloy for leak-free joints meeting TSSA standards</li>
              <li><strong>Line Sets:</strong> Pre-insulated or field-insulated paired refrigerant lines (liquid and suction) routed between equipment</li>
              <li><strong>Branch Joints:</strong> VRF systems require engineered refrigerant distribution boxes and branch piping to multiple indoor units</li>
              <li><strong>Evacuation & Charging:</strong> Proper system evacuation removing moisture and air before refrigerant charging</li>
            </ul>
