          <h2>Understanding VRF/VRV Technology</h2>
          <div className="explanation-content">
            <p>
              VRF (Variable Refrigerant Flow) and VRV (Variable Refrigerant Volume—Daikin's trademark) systems use advanced inverter technology to precisely control refrigerant flow to multiple indoor units throughout a building. Unlike traditional HVAC systems that operate at fixed capacity, VRF modulates compressor speed and refrigerant distribution to match exact building demands in real-time.
            </p>
            <h3>Key VRF/VRV Capabilities:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Simultaneous Heating & Cooling:</strong> Heat recovery VRF allows different Toronto building zones to heat or cool independently based on individual requirements</li>
              <li><strong>Multi-Zone Control:</strong> Single VRF system serves up to 64 indoor units with independent thermostatic control per zone</li>
              <li><strong>Modulating Capacity:</strong> Inverter-driven compressors operate from 10-100% capacity, matching output to actual building load</li>
              <li><strong>Energy Recovery:</strong> Heat rejected from cooling zones can be redirected to zones requiring heating, maximizing efficiency</li>
              <li><strong>Long Refrigerant Runs:</strong> VRF systems support refrigerant piping runs up to 1,000 feet with vertical lifts to 150 feet—ideal for Toronto high-rises</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>VRF/VRV Advantages for Toronto Commercial Buildings</h2>
          <div className="benefits-grid">
            <div className="benefit-item">
              <h3>Superior Energy Efficiency</h3>
              <p>VRF systems achieve SEER ratings up to 30+ and HSPF above 13. Toronto businesses reduce HVAC operating costs by 30-50% compared to traditional systems through precise capacity modulation and heat recovery.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="benefit-item">
              <h3>Individual Zone Comfort</h3>
              <p>Each indoor unit operates independently with its own thermostat. Toronto buildings eliminate comfort complaints from competing temperature preferences across different zones or tenant spaces.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="benefit-item">
              <h3>Reduced Installation Costs</h3>
              <p>Small refrigerant piping replaces bulky ductwork and hydronic piping. Toronto projects reduce mechanical space requirements, structural loads, and installation labor compared to traditional HVAC infrastructure.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="benefit-item">
              <h3>Flexible Building Design</h3>
              <p>VRF's long refrigerant runs and minimal mechanical space requirements give Toronto architects and engineers unprecedented design flexibility for commercial buildings and tenant improvements.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="benefit-item">
              <h3>Quiet Operation</h3>
              <p>Indoor units operate as quietly as 22 dB with advanced fan and refrigerant control. Critical for Toronto offices, hotels, and any commercial space where noise control matters.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="benefit-item">
              <h3>System Reliability</h3>
              <p>If one indoor unit fails, other zones continue operating normally. Toronto multi-tenant buildings maintain climate control even during equipment service or repairs.</p>

            <div className="type-card">
              <h3>Heat Pump VRF</h3>
              <p>
                Standard VRF configuration providing heating or cooling to all connected zones. Entire system operates in either heating or cooling mode. Best for Toronto applications where all zones have similar seasonal requirements.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="type-card">
              <h3>Heat Recovery VRF</h3>
              <p>
                Advanced VRF allowing simultaneous heating and cooling across different zones. Heat rejected from cooling zones transfers to zones requiring heating. Ideal for Toronto buildings with diverse thermal loads—perimeter offices needing heat while core zones require cooling.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="type-card">
              <h3>Air-Cooled VRF</h3>
              <p>
                Outdoor condenser units reject heat to ambient air. Standard configuration for Toronto VRF installations offering straightforward installation and reliable operation.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="type-card">
              <h3>Water-Cooled VRF</h3>
              <p>
                System rejects heat to cooling tower or water loop. Option for Toronto high-rises where rooftop space is limited or outdoor condensers aren't feasible due to building design.
